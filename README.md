# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

# CPPND Capstone Project: Snake Game

This project is a submission for the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Capstone Project, building upon the starter code provided by Udacity. The base project was inspired by a StackOverflow post, and the game mechanics resemble the classic Snake game. This README outlines the added features, instructions for building and running the game, and explains how the rubric points are met in this project.

## Game Enhancements and Modifications

Several key features have been introduced or modified from the starter code to improve gameplay:

1. **Boundary Walls**  
   The game now features solid boundaries on the edges, acting as walls. The snake must turn away upon contact with a wall or its own body. If a turn is not possible, the game ends. This design was inspired by the Google Snake game.

2. **Automatic Turning**  
   When the snake encounters its own body or a wall, it automatically attempts to turn left. If a left turn is not feasible, a right turn is attempted. The player can always override this automated behavior by providing a direction input.

3. **Dynamic Speed Adjustment**  
   Speed remains constant initially but slows down slightly as the snakeâ€™s length grows beyond 25 cells. Specifically, each time the snake grows, the speed decreases by 5% until the snake reaches 35 cells, after which the speed stays fixed. This adjustment was found to improve gameplay experience by balancing challenge and control.

4. **Improved Visuals**  
   The snake's body is now rendered with a clear outline to enhance visual distinction between segments.

## Building and Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- **C++ compiler** (e.g., g++)
- **SDL2 library** for handling rendering and input (cross-platform installation instructions are provided below)

### Cross-Platform Installation Instructions

- **Ubuntu**: 
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev


Mac:

bash
Copy code
brew install sdl2
Windows:
Download and install SDL2 development libraries from SDL's official website. Follow platform-specific instructions for setup.

Building and Running the Game
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kjjjoP3/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game
Build the project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run the game:

bash
Copy code
./SnakeGame

New Features
1. Auto-Save High Score
The game automatically saves the highest score achieved and displays it upon restart.
File: src/scoremanager.cpp

2. Dynamic Snake Speed Increase
The snake's speed increases each time it eats food.
File: src/snake.cpp

3. User-Controlled Speed Boost
The player can increase the snake's speed by pressing the p key.
File: src/controller.cpp

Rubric Points Addressed

*Compiling and Running the Program
- The project builds and runs without errors.
*Loops, Functions, I/O
- Control Structures and Functions: A variety of control structures and functions are used.
     Files: src/game.cpp, src/snake.cpp
- File I/O: Reads and writes data to a file.
     File: src/scoremanager.cpp
- User Input: Captures and handles user input.
     File: src/controller.cpp
*Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes: The project uses classes that encapsulate data and functions.
     Files: src/snake.h, src/game.h
- Access Specifiers: All class data members have appropriate access specifiers (public, protected, private).
     Files: src/snake.h, src/game.h
- Member Initialization Lists: Member initialization lists are used in constructors.
     File: src/game.cpp
- Function Overloading: Functions are overloaded with different parameters.
     File: src/snake.cpp
*Memory Management
- References: References are used in function declarations.
     Files: src/game.h, src/renderer.h
- Destructors: Proper destructors are implemented.
     Files: src/renderer.cpp, src/scoremanager.cpp
- RAII: RAII principles are used where applicable.
     Files: src/game.cpp, src/snake.cpp
*Concurrency
- Multithreading: Multithreading is used in the project.
     File: src/game.cpp
- Mutex: Mutex is used to protect shared data.
     File: src/game.cpp
*References
- Code references from StackOverflow posts and official SDL documentation.
- Code Reference: Functions Renderer::RenderBlock and Renderer::RenderBody take parameters by reference (renderer.h, lines 16-21). The getter for Snake::body also returns a const reference.
